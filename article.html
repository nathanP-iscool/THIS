            <p>Teen Health, Information and Safety is an organization that targets teens mental health issues and suicide prevention. Did you know that every 1 in 2 people are impacted by suicide before they turn 25? That is absolutely devastating.&nbsp;As in 2020, suicide was the most common cause of death for young people aged 15-24 years.&nbsp;<strong>402 young people aged 15-24 died by suicide</strong>, representing 13.0 deaths by suicide per 100,000 people. That doesn't sit right with us so we decided to make this organization to show teenagers that they belong and they're&nbsp;<strong>important.</strong></p>
